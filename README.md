This folder contains a basic p5play template to help get you started on your own p5play project! 😃🎮

## Contents

`favicon.png` - the icon for the web page, which appears on the browser tab
`index.html` - the webpage that runs your sketch.js code
`jsconfig.json` - a file that enables auto-complete and hover documentation for p5play in code editors like Visual Studio Code
`sketch.js` - write your code in the sketch file

## Getting Started

Use the [p5play VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quinton-ashley.p5play-vscode) or [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for Visual Studio Code to run your project.

## Offline Use

For offline use, install [bun](https://bun.sh/) or [npm](https://nodejs.org). Then in the file menu hover over "Terminal" and select "New Terminal". In your p5play project folder run `bun i` to install the q5 and p5play packages.

Note that to participate in p5play game jams your project must use the latest version of p5play. Use `bun up` or `npm up` to update packages to the latest versions.

## Read me, Read me!

This message will now self-destruct in 5... 4... just kidding! But you can delete the contents of this file and write a README.md file that describes your own project.
